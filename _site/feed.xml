        <title>Bash Scripting</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;all-roads-lead-to-bash&quot;&gt;All Roads Lead to Bash&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I once again found myself writing some bash scripts while
restructuring how some of our Chronos jobs are deployed here at
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reonomy.com/&quot;&gt;Reonomy&lt;/a&gt;. The truth is I would say at least every
couple of months I come up aginst a problem where a reasonable solution is to
write a quick bash script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes this involves writing a once off and sometimes it means writing
somethign that will live a little longer but the one thing that is consistent
is I almost always want to get done with the scripting and on to the next phase
of the problem. This is a reasonable enough desire but I think that I have been
missing an oppertunity to improve my bash-foo and be in a better position for
the next time a bash sized problem appears, as it surely will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I have taken  all the scripts I wrote this time and added them, some
slightly modified, to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mcmonkeyman/bash-playground&quot;&gt;bash
playground&lt;/a&gt; the goal here is to
try and become more disiplined about building up a decent bank of usefull
scripts and alsoto develop a good starting template to help the Eoin of the
future :)&lt;/p&gt;
