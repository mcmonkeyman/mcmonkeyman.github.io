# All Roads Lead to Bash

Last week I once again found myself writing some bash scripts while
restructuring how some of our Chronos jobs are deployed here at
[Reonomy](https://www.reonomy.com/). The truth is I would say at least every
couple of months I come up aginst a problem where a reasonable solution is to
write a quick bash script.

Sometimes this involves writing a once off and sometimes it means writing
somethign that will live a little longer but the one thing that is consistent
is I almost always want to get done with the scripting and on to the next phase
of the problem. This is a reasonable enough desire but I think that I have been
missing an oppertunity to improve my bash-foo and be in a better position for
the next time a bash sized problem appears, as it surely will.

So I have taken  all the scripts I wrote this time and added them, some
slightly modified, to [bash
playground](https://github.com/mcmonkeyman/bash-playground) the goal here is to
try and become more disiplined about building up a decent bank of usefull
scripts and alsoto develop a good starting template to help the Eoin of the
future :)
