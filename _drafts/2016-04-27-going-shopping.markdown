As developers we frequently come up against 'well worn problems'. These problems have been solved
time and time again and often there are a number of solutions readily available.

Alternatively we need to integrate with a technology or product and there is no stand out solution
for our current language or framework.

Furthermore, If there are a number of of the shelve solutions we often anchor to the technology we know. 
While this often works out sometimes we miss out on an easier, more robust, maintainable solution.
One way to guard against this is to 'go shopping'.

Things to consider when going shopping:
* Async support
* Libraries
  * Stars
  * Last update
  * Over all commits
  * Active users
  * Test quality and coverage
