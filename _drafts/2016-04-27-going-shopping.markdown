As developers we frequently come up against 'well worn problems'. These problems have been solved
time and time again and often there are a number of solutions readily available.

Alternatively we need to integrate with a technology or product and there is no stand out driver
for our current language or framework.

If there are a number of off the shelve solutions we often anchor to the technology we know. 
While this often works out we sometimes miss out on a more robust and maintainable solution.
One way to guard against this is to 'go shopping'.

Things to consider when going shopping:
* Async support
* Libraries
  * Stars
  * Last update
  * Over all commits
  * Active users
