<p>A better Hp Touch</p>
<p>I decided it was about time I put the HP Touch I received as a lovely gift from my cousins to good use. I wanted a tablet that would provide my with the most recent news but it needed to update daily and work offline as I commute to work using the subway.</p>
<p>I didn't feel that the native webOS suitable for this so I installed Android  following the instructions at <a title="The CyanogenMode Install Guide" href="http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Install_CM_for_tenderloin">the CyanogenMod wiki</a>. One caveats that I found were that there was no stable version only the nightly but it works fine.</p>
<p>I then installed a number of newspaper apps,  Google Reader and Pocket. My next post will be to get these apps working offline.</p>
