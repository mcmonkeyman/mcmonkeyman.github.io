<p>Had a problem after I restructured webpage and the coda's SVN commit failed. The solution was to resolve conflicts and push repository  over the command line.</p>
<p>Commands from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2406469/svn-remains-in-conflict">this link</a>:<code><br />
svn remove --force filename<br />
svn resolve --accept=working filename<br />
svn commit<br />
</code></p>
<p>A secondary issue was that theSVN_EDITOR variable needed to be set. A <a href="http://www.antbrown.com/web-development/svn-could-not-use-external-editor-to-fetch-log-message/">work around</a> is to  use the  -m "" flag.</p>
